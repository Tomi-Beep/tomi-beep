# Hi there, I'm Tomi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a **2nd-year undergraduate student** at the **Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE)**, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. Currently in my **4th semester**, I'm enthusiastic about learning and growing in the field of technology.  

Yes, that's me on the profile pic, do not take the picture seriously, it's supposed to be quirky and different. It's the moment I fell in love with my friend's mother's sunglasses.

## ðŸ”§ Skills  

- **C++**: Mastered structural programming and object-oriented programming - god knows I lost my mind with understanding pointers perfectly.  
- **Java**: Built a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures - yet somehow managed to answer LIFO == Queue, which lost our team first place in a cafÃ© quiz (the adrenalin got to me okay?).  
- **Python**: Currently focusing on artificial intelligence to expand my expertise.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  

My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute to exciting projects while learning from others. 

I am literally bursting with creative ideas, but turning them to reality? Thatâ€™s where my lack of practical experience comes in. However! I've recently dived into learning **Kotlin** and Iâ€™m gearing up to create my **very first actually useful app**.
